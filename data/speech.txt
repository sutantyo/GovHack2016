Hi, my name is Daniel, and this is


We attended the GovHack node at Collaboratory in Parramatta, kindly hosted by
Andrew (last name)

and we chose to work with the data that was provided to us by the Parramatta council

One data in particular which we found to bne very interesting is the
service request,
I am guessing this is a collection of request that the council performs,

for example, if garbage bin is missed

The data was not in the best state,
the service request contains addresses where the request originated, and there is
another spreadsheet that contains the latitude and longitude and addresses

however, there is discrepancy between how the addresses are represented in these
two spreadsheets, and in fact when we started, out of 25000 requests, 5000 had
unrecognised address.
We spent some hours fixing the data and we managed to reduce this down to 500, so
I'm happy to say that we have about 98% of the reported service request here.


We thought, well, this is a very interesting data, and when I was young I loved
SimCity, and it was always interesting to see what's happening in the various
neighbourhood in my city.

Scott combined a few more data, such as location of amenities: bus stops, train stations,
and managed to get a few more interesting data

The focus is always a particular location,

So let's take a look at the app

We have a basic working skeleton here, and the idea is that if you click anywhere
on the map, you will be able

There are over 200 distinct request types, so it would be an overkill to have 200 different

but most have same category

You can see some interesting
